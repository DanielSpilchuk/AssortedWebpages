# AssortedWebpages

This repository holds a sample webpage project for a Community Based Non-Profit organization and
several minigames which use javascript to run.

The project can mainly be used through a node server or through using a docker container.
The minigames can be played by running the html on a browser (Chrome is the only tested browser as of now).
